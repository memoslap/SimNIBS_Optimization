## changes to original folder structure
- the folder masks can be found here https://nextcloud.uni-greifswald.de/index.php/s/DNWfxJBPd4a527B
- download the folder and put all the file in the folder structure memoslap/simnibs_memoslap_utils/masks
- then the scripts should be running without any problem

## run the analysis
- in the folder run you find all the scripts necessary to run the optimization process

## What the utils do:
1) Create a coarse cerebellum central gm surface and add it to the m2m-folder content (only for charm results)
2) Map project-specific mask to the central gm surfaces. The mask can be either in fsaverage surface space (most projects) or in MNI volume space (e.g. project 6)
3) Get the position of center electrode
4) Set up and run the FEM simulations (sets also the surround electrode positions)
5) Map E-field quantities (magn, normal, tangent) onto the middle GM surfaces, and results of lh and rh to fsaverage (optional)
6) Get field medians and focalities
7) Export electrode positions for use with neuronavigation (only simnibs4)
8) Save some key results

## Notes:
* example.py in the examples folder shows how to use it
* the mask files are in simnibs_memoslap_utils/masks
* project_settings.py in simnibs_memoslap_utils contains all project-relevant settings (TODO: CHECK that they are correct and finalize!)
* electrode properties are specified in simu_settings.py (TODO: CHECK that they are correct!)
* the utils support iteration over different radii (see also exemple.py), but not phis
* focality values will be different for add_cerebellum=True versus add_cerebellum=False, as for the former case the area of the cerebellum surface will be included in the calculations
* when running with simnibs3, set add_cerebellum=False
* it should run with simnibs3, but is not tested yet (good luck!)

## GIT Installation
1. get account for git.simnibs.drcmr.dk  
2. install git on your computer (https://git-scm.com/)  
3. set up user name in local git, and store password in Windows Credentials  
	`git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"`  
	`git config --global user.email "MonaLisa@louvre.dk"`  
4. go to directory to which memoslap will be added as subfolder and run  
	`git clone https://git.simnibs.drcmr.dk/simnibs/memoslap.git`
